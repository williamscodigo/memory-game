## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a the app link
WHEN I load the app,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a screen with a start game button.

WHEN I click on the start game button,
THEN I am presented with one-player or two-player option
if i choose the one-player option I will play agains the computer else two-players.

WHEN I Choose between one-player or two-players option,
THEN cards are shuffle and randomly select player to start. (if time include rock, paper, scissors to choose first player to go)

4. On each turn, a player flips over two cards, one at a time.
5. If the cards match, the player keeps them and gets to take another turn. If the cards don't match, the player turns them face down again in the same position and the next player takes a turn.
7. Players should try to remember where the cards are.
8. When all the cards have been matched, players count their pairs and the player with the most pairs wins.

WHEN there is  a winner
THEN I want to be given the option to play again.
