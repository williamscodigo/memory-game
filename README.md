# Memory Card Game

## Description

This front-end development project, is a Memory Card Game, in which you and your oponent can take turns flipping cards revealing its content, each card content is duplicated exactly once which mean each card have a pair, the purpose of the game is to reveal a card following by its pair, if a pair is find that players keeps its turn and continue trying to find more pairs, if no pair is found it becomes the oponents turn. Game ends when all pairs have been found and the player with more pairs win the game.

We all deserve a break from our daily obligations and routines, as a web developer student and seen how other students also struggle with hw/activities/challenges/studying my team and I desided to create the game with web development technologies logo/icons, that way students can not only enjoy a simple memory game but also learn while playing it.

Everyone in my team including myself are new to the world of web development in particular to working with others, collaboration is one of the biggest challenges we came accross during this project because we all have different experiences, coding styles, project vision, time constraints, etc. At the end we all learned a little bit more about what colaboration is and why its important in web develoment and other software development projects.
